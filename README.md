# NotionWidgets
Widgets to embed HTML links on my notion enviroment.

To add new HTML widgets just create the file and embed the following link on notion:
https://pausalpa.github.io/NotionWidgets/filename.html

 1. [linkedinBadge.html](/linkedinBadge.html)
 
 This file has a problem, it was intended to be a badge from a code that LinkedIn provides so you can put it on your page, 
 seems that works well on Chrome but not on Firefox, that's why I leave it, but not use it.
 
 2. [weather.html](/weather.html)
 
 This file is the customized widget that came from the page https://weatherwidget.io/ to put a responsive weather widget on any web page.
